# PLY Protobuf

Protocol Buffers lexer &amp; parser for PLY

## Information
* ply/ subdirectory is present in this repo just for demonstration purposes only. If you intend to use this, prefer better original
 PLY repository which is up-to-date.
* This is my first PLY / parser generator project, there may be bugs although it works for me for quite complicated protocol buffers files. 
If you find a bug, please feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue.
* This work was inspired by:
  * [plyj] [1], Java lexer &amp; parser for PLY.
  * [pyparsing] [2], Protocol Buffers parsing example.
